Code Analysis:

1. The code is using the Streamlit library, which is a popular Python framework for building interactive web applications.

2. The code imports several libraries: `streamlit`, `pickle`, `pandas`, and `requests`.

3. The `fetch_poster` function takes a `movie_id` as input, makes a request to a movie API to retrieve data about the movie, and returns the URL of the movie poster image.

4. The `recommend` function takes a `movie` as input. It first finds the index of the movie in the `movies` DataFrame. It then calculates the similarity between the selected movie and all other movies using the `similarity` matrix. The movies are sorted based on their similarity to the selected movie. The function retrieves the top 5 most similar movies (excluding the selected movie itself) and their posters using the `fetch_poster` function. It returns two lists: `recommended_movies` and `recommended_movies_poster`.

5. The code loads two pickled files: `movie_dict.pkl` and `similarity.pkl`. These files contain a dictionary of movie data and a matrix of movie similarity scores, respectively.

6. The Streamlit application is created with the title "Movie Recommender System".

7. The user is presented with a select box (`selected_movie_name`) to choose a movie.

8. If the user clicks the "Recommend" button, the `recommend` function is called with the selected movie name as an argument. The returned movie names and posters are stored in the `names` and `posters` variables.

9. The code then displays the recommended movies and their posters using the Streamlit `st.columns` and `st.image` functions. It shows 5 columns, each containing the name and poster of a recommended movie.

Possible Interview Questions:

1. What is the purpose of the `fetch_poster` function in the code?
2. Explain how the `recommend` function works.
3. What is the role of the `movies_dict` and `similarity` variables?
4. What is the purpose of using the `pickle` library in the code?
5. How does the Streamlit framework facilitate building interactive web applications?
6. How does the code retrieve movie data and posters from an external API?
7. How does the code handle user input for selecting a movie?
8. What happens when the user clicks the "Recommend" button?
9. How are the recommended movies and their posters displayed on the web application?
10. Can you suggest any improvements or modifications to enhance the movie recommender system?
